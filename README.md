Recent work has begun to explore how different types of neural codes could function synergistically
to promote encoding of complementary information simultaneously.  Here, this idea is taken further
to propose a cortical process which encodes information along parallel channels that weave together
to create a cycle that is scalable across many levels and allows information to be distributed, noise
resistant, and invariant relative to the local scale.  Chandelier cells, with their unique axo-axonic cell-
cell connectivity, play a key role in facilitating the fast and seamless transition from one neural code
to another.  Lateral connections between chandelier cells as well as feedback from higher cortical
levels promote the rapid organization of the chandeliers’ target cells to create small cortical
neighborhoods such that the output from these neighborhoods can be tightly modulated.  A
consequence is that firing rate becomes coupled with position such that a spatially defined sparse
distributed code consisting of complementary information can be extracted in parallel to the raw rate
encoded information. Finally, temporal coding through relative phase between a target cell and its
surrounding neighborhood controls how this sparse code evolves over time to enable the cortical
process to form a complete circuit, thus making it extendable to hierarchical processing.  Ultimately,
it is controlled movement through this chandelier cell defined dynamic space which enables
homeostatic mechanisms to enhance signal to noise and direct this flow of information to create
robust, generalized representations that are so paramount for any hierarchical system.
